Welcome! If you are on this page chances are you made a search for a key term that I'm also interested in and have added to my brain dump. This blog is intended to compile a collection of subjects and thoughts that I find interesting enough to share with the rest of the world. 

I'm an avid technology content reader and like to dig around and experiment with new technologies and share my findings in the process. This space will serve as my brain dump on various topics around the technology the space with a focus on Cyber Security, Identity and Access Management, Cloud Computing and interesting technology problems.

I'm currently working in the Cyber Security space as a Sr. Architect focusing on Identity and Access Management, but I also like to dabble in other areas of the technology space as well.
