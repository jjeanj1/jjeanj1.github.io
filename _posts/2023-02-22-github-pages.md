Did you know that you can host your website on Github? If your answer is no, you are not alone. I recently wanted a developer friendly process to host my technical blog and came across the Github pages project.

Github Pages is an amazing project that provides the ability for someone to host their site on Github for free and leverage all the capabilities of Github to manage, version control, publish and host their site all for **FREE**. If you are interested, check out the project on <https://pages.github.com/>. In fact, this entire site is all hosted and managed by Github.

 As a developer, I had a set of requirements that needed to be satisfied and all my requirements were met:

1. Developer friendliness - having the ability to control the entire site management process as code. the entire site is based on the Jekyll opensource project which uses the markdown formating syntax that I was already familiar with which tremendously helped with updating and deploying my site in less than 30 minutes!
2. Backup and version control - the entire site is managed via Github leveraging the familiar Git code management processes (git commit, pull, push, etc..)
3. Custom Domain - having the ability to have my own custom domain
4. Freebie - The entire process is free! 

> I was recently using Wordpress to host my blog and I will be migrating everything over to my github pages! Not even looking back.
